You need to install `mvn` somewhere in your path
(http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), and you need to have the Java SDK
(which is not the same thing as the runtime) 1.7 (or 1.8). You can check with
`javac -version`. That is from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads. If you have 1.8 and
you want to set it aside, see
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#A1096903
for how to do this on a Mac.
